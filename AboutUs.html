                "Nidhi Chalaa Sukhamaa Raamuni Sannidhi Seva Sukhamaa" said Saint Thyagaraja. He lived his life through
                Vuncha Vruthi and spreading the Rama Bhakthi to all through his soulful Kruthis.
                Keeping up his legacy, his sishya koti continued this paramapara by imparting this musical bhakthi to
                their students.
                Our principal teacher at Sangeetha Bharathi, Dr. Padma Mallela belongs to Thyagaraja's shishya
                parampara and continues to uphold this tradition of music for bhakthi and Salvation, and teaches our
                students that music is a divine art that has to be learnt with bhakthi and dedication.
                <br />
                <br />
                We started off as a school back in 2004 with 30 students in a small house. Our motto is to provide
                students their own opportunities and not having to ask other people for chances to sing. We also wanted
                to provide a concert platform for students of Sangeetha Bharathi to gain experience in singing infront
                of a crowd in order to naturally increase their inner sponteinity. Today, with over 15 students with a "Diploma
                in music", Sangeetha Bharathi continues to train with the same integrity and commitment to produce
                quality music.</p>

                Initially our programmes were conducted at home as one hour concerts with a small crowd. As more and
                more students came along we started organising it on a larger scale and the first annual event,
                Annamayya Padahela, started. We also conducted Swaranjali, a tribute to our gurus and guru parampara,
                where we sang compositions of our gurus to honour them.
                <br />
                <br />
                Eventually, we started inviting artistes from India to perform in New Zealand, along with our partners
                because music is not about just performing and training but also listening and appreciating good music.
                Through this, students get an opportunity to improve their skills by listening to the professionals in
                the field and creating their own style from what they hear and practice.

            The great saint Thyagaraja trained several disciples during his time in the Tanjaore district and
            made
            them into musicians.
            He passed away in 1847 leaving behind a wealth of compositions that his students had learnt.
            Among his disciples, one such composer was Sri Akumalla Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayya.
            He was the guru to the great composer Sri Patnam Subramanya Iyer. He lived between 1803- 1862 and
            among his students, one was Sri Susarla Dakshinamurthy Sastry
            (1860-1917). <br /><br />
            Sri Susarla Dakshinamurthy had travelled all the way to Tamilnadu by foot from Andhra Pradesh just
            to
            learn music from his guru.
            After he learnt under him, he returned to Andhra pradesh to spread his knowledge in music.
            He was the first person to have bought the tradition of Saint Thyagaraja to Andhra Pradesh. It was
            from him that Sri Parupalli Ramakrishnayya panthulu (1883-1951) had learnt music.
            After that, the great Dr. Mangalampally Balamuralikrishna had trained under him since he was a
            child.
            Not only was Sri Ramakrishnayya Pantulu adept in vocal music, but he also taught his students music
            on
            the violin simultaneously.
            It is here from where Dr. Balamuralikrishna learnt the violin, along with his classmates Sri
            Annavarapuu Ramaswamy and Sri Neti Srirama Sarma. <br /><br />
            Our principal, Dr. Padma Govardhan had the chance to learn from all three of these gurus.
            This rich style of music formed the roots of her learning, along with experience learning under Sri
            Gadde Ramakumari, who was also a disciple of Sri Annavarapu Ramaswamy.
            Today, she continues to impart this knowledge to her students and turn them into musicians that can
            continue this heritage.
            <br /><br />Dr Padma evinced interest in Carnatic music even during her formative years but it was
            when she
            was 12 years old that she began
            learning the art in her native Vijayawada, from Annavarapu Ramaswamy and Ramakumari. Years later,
            moving to Chennai, she completed
            the ‘Sangeetha Ratna’ course from the Music Academy, under the guidance of Sangeetha Kalanidhi
            B Rajam
            Iyer and S R Janakiraman.
            It was during this time that she also trained undr Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna. Relocating to
            Hyderabad,
            she learnt Carnatic Music
            from Sri Neti Rama Sharma and she and completed her post-graduation in Music from University of
            Madras
            throuch distance education,
            all while teaching and attending to her family. She is also a graduate in Science with Botany as a
            major subject and a
            postgraduate in Public Administration. But this deeply-rooted thirst for music did not end there.
            <br /><br />Dr. Padma received her Doctorate in Carnatic music from Mother Theresa University,
            Kodaikanal in
            2016 on her topic of research,
            "An in-depth analysis of Shankarabharam and its Janya Ragas" under the guidance of Dr. Radha
            Venkatachalam,
            retired professor of Delhi University.<br /> <br />Even as she pursued her own educational pathway
            as a
            doctorate student,
            Dr Padma has been imparting her knowledge to hundreds of students, with fifteen of them completing
            their graduation in Carnatic Music examinations conducted by the London based Academy of Fine Arts
            and
            the New Zealand Carnatic Music Society (Auckland), recognised by the University of Madras.
